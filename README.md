# Dashboard Project README

## Overview

This project involves building a responsive dashboard to manage claims, documentation, and file uploads. The design adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Flexbox and media queries.

## Approach

1. **Layout**: The dashboard includes sections for claims details, document uploads, and progress tracking, all laid out using Flexbox for responsiveness.
2. **Responsive Design**: Media queries adjust the layout for tablet and mobile devices, ensuring content is easy to view and interact with on different screen sizes.
3. **Form & Styling**: Simple, user-friendly forms with adaptive input fields and button styles for smaller screens.

## Challenges & Resolutions

1. **Responsive Layout**: Ensured proper alignment and spacing across devices using Flexbox and media queries.
2. **Design Consistency**: Tuned margins, padding, and font sizes to maintain a consistent design on mobile and desktop.
3. **Horizontal Scrolling**: Prevented overflow issues by setting `width: 100%` and `box-sizing: border-box` for all elements.

## Assumptions

1. Target devices are tablets and mobiles, with desktop as default.
2. Basic form validation assumed (no advanced error handling).
3. Users upload standard document types (PDF, DOCX, etc.).

## Future Improvements

1. **Form Validation**: Add more detailed validation for user inputs.
2. **File Upload**: Implement drag-and-drop support and file size indicators.
3. **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility features like screen reader support.

## Conclusion

The dashboard is designed to be simple, responsive, and user-friendly, with future enhancements focusing on validation, file uploads, and accessibility.
